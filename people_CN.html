        <p>Yongfeng Zhou, Professor from the Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen (AGIS) of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS). Before joining AGIS, he did a Ph.D. in University of Oulu and a postdoc in University of California, Irvine, under the supervision of Prof. Outi Savolainen and Prof. Brandon Gaut, respectively. The Zhou lab studies the population genetics of crop domestication and genomic breeding, mining adaptive, deleterious, structural variants, regulatory networks and phenotype/environment-genotype associations in OMICS data of crops and their wild relatives to practice breeding 4.0 of grapevine and other horticultural crops. </p>

            Her research interests focus on the studies of transposable elements (TEs) in the grapevine. 
            More specially, she works on the development of methods with high precision to detect TEs and design genetic markers to improve breeding based on TEs for the grapevine. 
            In addition, her interests also involve the integration of multi-omics data and establishing the regulatory networks in the grapevine.</p>
